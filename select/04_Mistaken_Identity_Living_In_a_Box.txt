I'm not mistaken, or you're only faking
You're only faking, or I'm not mistaken

You've been hiding for a long time girl
Behind that "she's a maniac" reputation
Disguising a soft hearted girl
But the innocence in your eyes tells no lies
Anyone who knows your face will recognise
The time and place
But I know they must be mistaken

(Mistaken identity)
It's not what it seems to be
Just a case of mistaken identity
You're playing a part
When real love calls
Behind it all, it's you
You'll have to face up to if I'm not mistaken

Sometimes it's criminal what you've got to go through
To need to have two people inside of you
One is soft, the other one's hard and tough
But that's the one you make yourself a prisoner of
Walls are only built of pride
Through eyes of love I see inside
Bring out the one you've forsaken

(Mistaken identity)
You're not what it seems to be
Just a case of mistaken identity
You're playing a part
When real love calls
Behind it all, it's you
You'll have to face up to if I'm not mistaken

I'm not mistaken, or you're only faking
You're only faking, or I'm not mistaken

Anyone who knows your face will recognise
The time and place
But I know they must be mistaken

(Mistaken identity)
You're not what you seem to be
Just a case of mistaken identity

(Mistaken identity)
You're playing a part
When real love calls
Behind it all, it's you
You'll have to face up to if I'm not mistaken
Mistaken
