Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Did she tell you it's over?
Did she throw you out in the night?
Here you come to your other lover
Thinking that a reckless heart
Will get you high again

But I changed the number on my telephone
You won't find me when you come calling

And I'll say
(Must be a case) of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity

Did you think I'd be waiting for you?
Did you think I'd be holding my breath
To hear the songs of your footsteps
Saying it's all over with her
And now you need me
You need me

But I changed the number on my telephone
You won't find me when you come calling

And I'll say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity

So don't try to call me anymore with your lies
Don't be a fool and make the mistake of
Thinking I still love you
Anyone can tell I'm fine
And I don't need you

But I changed the number on my telephone
You won't find me when you come calling

I'll just say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity

Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be, no
Must be a case of mistaken identity

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
