I'm coming to you
Check this out, It's my style
鼓動響く Rum pum pum
I walk to my timeline
他の Noise なら cut block out
ほら自由でいい Out fit
Do you find me a mystery?
誰かでも何でもない
"特別" なのそれが "I"
真似できないこの Way
たった一つ I'm making it
My attitude overflowing with charm
自信それさえ Fashion
What? 例がない?(yeah)
But that's the real me
The path I'm walking is my runway
高く鳴らすわ Tension
大きな Question mark
There's only one answer
It's deep inside my heart
Just be me (yeah)
I know what I want
Who I am
My Identity
誰かじゃない Shining now
My Identity
感じて and like it
比べられない This is me
I'm all right
I'm special and I know it
Umm ah
I'm feeling feeling myself
Don't you want to feel yourself?
Always me, myself, and I
Woo Identity-dentity-dentity
Princess, Hero, Queendom じゃない
It's enough for me just to be myself
Everyone's Royalty
鳴り響いてく Trumpet
Vibe with it, my beat
Dum-dum
You get it, right? 止められない yeah
一瞬で Shining bright
ピリつく刺激 Feel so right
向き合う Day and night
逃げるわけがない
If it cannot be stopped
Yes, Welcome (yeah)
I know what I want
Who I am
My Identity
誰かじゃない Shining now
My Identity
感じて and like it
比べられない This is me
I'm all right
I'm special and I know it
Umm ah
I'm feeling feeling myself
Don't you want to feel yourself?
Always me, myself, and I
Woo Identity-dentity-dentity
I'm feeling feeling myself
Don't you want to feel yourself?
Always me, myself, and I
Woo Identity-dentity-dentity
